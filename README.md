# ðŸ¤– AI Agents: Building Practical LLM-Powered Tools

This repository contains hands-on examples and mini-projects that demonstrate how to build **AI agents** using **LLMs** (like OpenAI's GPT) and frameworks such as **LangChain** and **LangGraph**. These agents can perform real-world tasks like analyzing a codebase, reading files, calling tools, and even generating `README.md` files automatically.

## ðŸš€ What You'll Learn

- How to design **LLM-powered agents** with memory, context, and tool usage
- How to use **LangChain** and **LangGraph** to manage agent behavior
- How to build agents that:
  - Analyze GitHub repositories
  - Read and understand code files
  - Generate structured markdown output (e.g. `README.md`)
